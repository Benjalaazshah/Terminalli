-   Ability to have _relative_ timestamps. These include timestamps relative to when the previous message was logged to the console.
-   Being able to add or remove any of these types of timestamps from your logs.
-   Having the ability to log errors. These error logs are highlighted in red.

## CUSTOMIZABILITY
