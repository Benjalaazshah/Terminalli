## FEATURES

This is not a feature-rich package. None the less, features include:

-   Ability to have each log show the exact date and time when it was logged.
-   Ability to have _relative_ timestamps. These include timestamps relative to when the previous message was logged to the console.
-   Being able to add or remove any of these types of timestamps from your logs.
-   Having the ability to log errors. These error logs are highlighted in red.

## CUSTOMIZABILITY

Terminalli offers the ability to add or remove any of these features to your liking. The following picture illustrates how you change the way your logs look.
