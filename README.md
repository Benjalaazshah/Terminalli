## FEATURES

### **Features include:**

-   Ability to have each log show the exact date and time when it was sent to the console.
-   Ability to have _relative_ timestamps in your logs. These include timestamps relative to when the previous message was logged to the console.
-   Being able to add or remove any of these types of timestamps from your logs.
-   ![[ NEW ]](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NEW-008000.svg?style=square "New") You are now able to log to up to 6 different preset levels/categories, all of which have there own color.
-   ![[ NEW ]](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NEW-008000.svg?style=square "New") As well as that, you can create custom levels with whatever color you desire!

## BASIC USAGE

First, import the `Terminal` class from Terminalli.

```js
import Terminal from "terminalli";
```

Next up is to create your terminal.

```js
const terminal = new Terminal({
	levels: [
		// Levels...
	]
});
```

Right inside of `levels` is where you are free to define your different levels/categories that you can log to. But to save time, you can import a bunch of preset levels like this:

```js
import Terminal, { advancedLevels } from "terminalli";

const terminal = new Terminal({ levels: advancedLevels });
```

> ![[ NOTE ]](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NOTE-000080.svg?style=square "Note") If you want to learn how to create custom levels, continue reading [here](./README.md#custom-levels 'View "CUSTOM LEVELS" section').

To start logging things, do so like this:

```js
terminal.log.debug("Initial log.");
```

`debug` in this case is the name of one of the preset levels that you can log to. If you were logging an error, for example, you can use the `error` level.

```js
terminal.log.error("Something happened.");
```

### **Output:**

## CUSTOMIZABILITY

Upon creating a new instance of the `Terminal` class, you can turn on and off a bunch of options that determine how logs are to be displayed in the terminal. In the following example, there are three instances of the `Terminal` class all with different settings.

### **Code:**

```js
import Terminal, { advancedLevels } from "terminalli";

const t1 = new Terminal({
	levels: advancedLevels
});

const t2 = new Terminal({
	levels: advancedLevels,
	showDate: true,
	showLevelName: true,
	showTimestampRelativeToLastLog: false,
	use24HourClock: true
});

const t3 = new Terminal({
	levels: advancedLevels,
	showArrow: true,
	showRelativeTimestamp: true,
	showTimestamp: false
});

t1.log.warn("The fox is coming...");
t2.log.warn("The fox is coming...");
t3.log.warn("The fox is coming...");
```

### **Output:**

## CUSTOM LEVELS

Creating custom levels is as simple as it gets! In the following example, there are two additional custom levels, alongside the preset levels, called `weather` and `victory`.

### **Code:**

```js
import Terminal, { advancedLevels } from "terminalli";

const terminal = new Terminal({
	showLevelName: true,

	levels: [
		...advancedLevels,
		{
			color: ["bgGreen", "white", "bold"],
			isError: false,
			name: "victory"
		},
		{
			color: ["cyan", "bold", "underline"],
			isError: false,
			name: "weather"
		}
	]
});

terminal.log.weather("Today will be 280Â°C (about the same as an oven).");
terminal.log.victory("The octopus has won.");
```
