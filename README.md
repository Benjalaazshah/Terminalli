## FEATURES

This is not a feature-rich package. None the less, features include:

-   Ability to have each log show the exact date and time when it was sent to the console.
-   Ability to have _relative_ timestamps. These include timestamps relative to when the previous message was logged to the console.
-   Being able to add or remove any of these types of timestamps from your logs.
-   Having the ability to log errors. These error logs are highlighted in red.
-   ![[ NEW ]](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NEW-800000.svg?style=square) You are now able to have timestamps in both the 12 hour and 24 hour clock.
-   ![[ NEW ]](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NEW-800000.svg?style=square) You now can display dates in both "month before day" and "day before month" formats.

## CUSTOMIZABILITY

Terminalli offers the ability to add or remove any of these features to your liking. The following picture illustrates how you change the way your logs look.
